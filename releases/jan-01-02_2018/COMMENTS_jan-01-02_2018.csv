The only thing is that wouldn't you expect the first ""too long"" argument to mess up the sync with the argument list for the later argument? IOW, if the order is `*walker`, `*head` in the `printf` statement, shouldn't `*head` get messed up instead of, as it happens, `*walker` messing up and `head` getting the 1?","2018-01-01 02:27:50","","2812104"

When making complex and large-scale applications especially in Android you should always try to modularize your code. Firstly identify important function in your code to be performed and then write a function for each of the important actions. This enables reusability of your code too. Well, the debate on modularity can go on and on.

"83066324","48047053","0","@DanielLee, `double` is the common type of `int` and `double`. Mainly because converting `int` to `double` commonly either preserves the value or approximates it reasonably. In fact, it's common for conversions from a 32-bit `int` to a `double` to be non-narrowing, as IEEE-754 doubles can store up to ±2⁵³ without loss of precision. On the flip side, converting from `double` to `int` misses out on many, many values. C++ simply requires the conditional expression to resolve to a compile-time-known type, so it chooses the one that doesn't miss out on tons of values from the other.","2018-01-01 05:31:11","","962089"

When running a task as ""NETWORK SERVICE"" or ""LOCAL SERVICE"", the process Token should have an ""NT TASK"" SID based on the task name. If the task is in a folder, replace backslashes in the path with hyphens. For example, a task named ""Spam\LaunchTask"" would have the SID ""NT TASK\Spam-LaunchTask"" in its Token. Once the service task is created, its SID is registered with the system, and you can use it to grant access, e.g. for files via icacls.exe.","2018-01-01 07:38:55","","205580"

In any case there's a widely established practice to use a null value to mean specifically ""the pointer does not reference anything"", up to the point I doubt on even existence of a code that uses null to actually reference the null address, perhaps if exploits. IOW even if standard does not treat null pointers in any special way, *conceptually* a null pointer does not reference anything.","2018-01-01 08:10:37","","2388257"

Google sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API.

My conclusion:
It looks like there's a very gray area for analyzing user data (even without user's PII) there that I'm not sure if it falls under the first prohibition.

To fix it: Go to control panel -> Internet options -> Connections ->LAN Settings ->Unmark 'use proxy server' options. Try using pip after this, it should work. You can start using proxy server after installing the package.  .

If you plan to use GCC, then the suffix really isn't needed.

I have done authorization a couple of times (and different ways) with servant, you can see a summary [here](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant-auth/issues/73#issuecomment-349737003) but long story short: I don't think authorization groups & what not belong to the API type, this is a private piece of information that only the server knows and cares about, and you can achieve what you want with a simple helper function or two. If you really want to explore adding authorization things to the API type, keep us posted, I just haven't found a nice way to make this work.","2018-01-01 09:47:54","","193424"

It means that using these functions to convert a Latin1/Latin9 string to UTF8 and back, always gives the original Latin1/Latin9 string. The conversion itself is only *correct* for Latin9. If you want to change that, you need to edit the code of both functions for Latin1 code points.

It's async so it can't go to initialState. You should:

- make an action creator that fetches this data

- when the data is fetched dispatch an action with this data, e.g:

```
{ type: 'CATEGORIES_LOAD', data: data }
```
- make a reducer which updates this store

And execute this action creator when your component mounts, e.g. componentWillMount if you also use React.","2018-01-01 10:19:57","","1781184"

The user-land libraries just feel like if there is no kernel. But there is, when the functions which are missing in the user-land libraries are hooked by the kernel.

When data model ""grows"", by adding table-by-table as requirements change; when you're about to create the final data model, ALTER TABLE is the savior).

"83071288","48044981","0","Exactly, if you have 2 songs with 5000 notes each, then `songs` has shape `(2, 5000, 4)`. In this case, the shape of `x` would be `(2*(5000-10), 10, 4)` and `y` would be `(2*(5000-10), 4)`. Here, `samples_per_song` holds the number of training examples that you obtain by sliding a window of length `window_length`. For example, note that you can slide 5000-10=4990 times a window of length 10 on a song of length 5000, and each of these vectors is a training example. The label is then the note that comes right after the window. `n_samples` is the total number of examples, combining all the songs.","2018-01-01 12:52:08","","5140223"

If the latter is what you want, then you *could* use Vector3f.lerp(), but you need the time it takes your character to reach the desired ""goal"" velocity and you need to store the current interpolation parameter value in-between frames.","2018-01-01 13:50:59","","8623159"

Actions greater than 1 will consistently be interpreted as being equal to 1 by the environment, so it's fine to reward them all as if the agent had chosen just 1. Also note that the environment's action space (in the case of gym) is defined as [-1.0, 1.0] too. So really agents shouldn't generate any output outside of that range anyway. I guess an alternative would be to ''disqualify'' an agent for illegal actions or something like that, but this works just fine too and is a bit more forgiving","2018-01-01 17:00:34","","6735980"

The logging module is designed to work as a sort of singleton for the root logging instance; meanwhile, handlers are stackable and hence not-singleton-ish. So you end up with a crazy-quilt set of possibilities for each worker. sayan's answer—doing logging from a single point—is a lot easier to keep straight in your head.","2018-01-01 17:46:13","","1256452"

Meanwhile Git has things it calls *branch names* and very different things that it calls *remote-tracking branch names*. I think you may be better off by starting with the concept of *commits* here.

Then, the predictions might appear to be slightly ""shifted"" because the price change at timestep t+1 is slightly correlated with the price change at timestep t (but still, predicting something close to 0 is the safest choice).","2018-01-01 22:20:19","","5140223"

SSE2 gives you SIMD and scalar for `double`-precision floats in XMM registers (`addpd` and so on), so it's a big deal.  But yes, AVX detection requires checking that the OS has enabled it.  You can do that without any system calls, though, just CPUID + check that xsave is enabled.  You probably don't need to write the CPU detection / dispatching yourself; depending on your compiler, there are probably functions to help with this.  Use them.","2018-01-01 20:54:32","","224132"
