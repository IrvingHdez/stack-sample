I'm trying to determine if these two groups' distributions are different in a statistically significant way.

What tests/procedures/methods should I use to determine whether or not these two groups are significantly different and how do I do that in SAS or R (or Orange)?",,

There was also the [**""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures""** paper][4] by Leo Breiman in 2001 which argued that Statisticians rely too heavily on data modeling, and that machine learning techniques are making progress by instead relying on the *predictive accuracy* of models.

Has the Statistics field changed over the last decade in response to these critiques?  Do the *two cultures* still exist or has Statistics grown to embrace machine learning techniques such as neural networks and support vector machines?
