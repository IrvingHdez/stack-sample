<p>Simon Blomberg: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From R's fortunes
  package: To paraphrase provocatively,
  'machine learning is statistics minus
  any checking of models and
  assumptions'.
  -- Brian D. Ripley (about the difference between machine learning
  and statistics) useR! 2004, Vienna

</blockquote>

<p>Andrew Gelman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In that case, maybe we should get rid
  of checking of models and assumptions
  more often. Then maybe we'd be able to
  solve some of the problems that the
  machine learning people can solve but
  we can't!</p>

<p>There was also the <a href=""http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726""><strong>""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures""</strong> paper</a> by Leo Breiman in 2001 which argued that statisticians rely too heavily on data modeling, and that machine learning techniques are making progress by instead relying on the <em>predictive accuracy</em> of models.</p>

<p>Has the statistics field changed over the last decade in response to these critiques?  Do the <em>two cultures</em> still exist or has statistics grown to embrace machine learning techniques such as neural networks and support vector machines?</p>
